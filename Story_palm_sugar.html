    <h2>Story of palm sugar</h2>
    <p>The story of making sugar from this palm tree is a myth that has been passed down through the ages. The story is that a farmer was sleeping under the palm tree; he suddenly woke up because a sweetwater dropped to his mouth. He sat up and looked around but not see anything. He felt curious, so he climbed the tree to see that drop of water had just fallen from the bud of the broken palm tree. He used a bamboo tube containing and brought to show off his family. So since then, people still keep the custom of using a bamboo tube as a mean of collecting palm juice from the trees.</p>
